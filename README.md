# study-buddy-website-using-bootstrap
Created "Study-Buddy" website using Bootstrap cards, grid, and buttons
StudyBuddy is a web app that helps you find the perfect study partner based on shared subjects, goals, and learning styles.
💡 Built with the idea that studying doesn’t have to be lonely — this app connects students who vibe on the same academic wavelength.
🧑‍💻 Features:
Select subjects & preferred study hours
Get matched with like-minded learners
Option to connect & plan sessions
Clean UI with a friendly and approachable design
This project helped me practice user-centric design, form building, layout planning, and thinking like a product developer in training 👩‍💻🚀
